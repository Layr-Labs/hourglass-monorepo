- [ ] **Configuration Mode Selection** - Choose docker vs kubernetes deployment
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility** - Preserve existing Docker support

### ‚ùå 3.2 gRPC Connection Management
- [ ] **Service DNS Connection** - Connect via stable service names
- [ ] **Connection Pooling** - Pool gRPC connections to performers
- [ ] **Retry Logic** - Handle connection failures gracefully
- [ ] **Load Balancing** - Support multiple performer replicas

## ‚ùå Phase 4: Deployment & Operations

### ‚ùå 4.1 Helm Charts
- [ ] **Operator Deployment:**
  - [ ] Operator pod with RBAC permissions
  - [ ] CRD installation and upgrades  
  - [ ] ConfigMap for operator configuration

- [ ] **Custom Metrics** - Performer lifecycle events
- [ ] **Logging Integration** - Cluster logging stack integration
- [ ] **Health Checks** - Readiness and liveness probes

### ‚ùå 4.3 Security Considerations
- [ ] **Pod Security Standards** - Compliance implementation
- [ ] **Network Policies** - Performer isolation rules
- [ ] **Secret Management** - Secure configuration handling
- [ ] **Node Affinity** - Secure node placement rules

## ‚ùå Phase 5: Advanced Features

### ‚ùå 5.1 High Availability
- [ ] **Leader Election** - Multiple executor replicas with leader election
- [ ] **Affinity Rules** - Performer distribution across nodes
- [ ] **Failure Handling** - Graceful node failure recovery

### ‚ùå 5.2 Auto-scaling
- [ ] **HPA Integration** - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for executors
- [ ] **Custom Metrics** - Performer demand-based scaling
- [ ] **Resource Scaling** - Resource-based scaling decisions

# TypeScript Performer Scaffold Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a minimal TypeScript SDK that allows AVS builders to write Hourglass performers in TypeScript with minimal setup. This provides an alternative to Go for developers who prefer TypeScript/Node.js.

## Architecture Analysis
The TypeScript SDK provides the same capabilities as the Go performer framework:

1. **Implement PerformerService gRPC interface** with:
   - `ExecuteTask`: Main task processing endpoint
   - `HealthCheck`: Returns performer status
   - `StartSync`: Initialization endpoint

2. **Provide Worker Interface** for user implementations:
   - `validateTask(task)`: Validate incoming task
   - `handleTask(task)`: Process task and return result

3. **Handle gRPC Communication**:
   - Receive `TaskRequest` with task_id and payload (bytes)
   - Return `TaskResponse` with task_id and result (bytes)

    // Validation logic
  }
  
  async handleTask(task: TaskRequest): Promise<TaskResponse> {
    const input = this.parsePayload(task.payload);
    const result = input * input; // Square the number
    return this.createResponse(task.taskId, result);
  }
}

// Start server
const server = new MyPerformer({ port: 8080 });
server.start();
